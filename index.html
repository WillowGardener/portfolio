                My name is Griffin; I'm a programmer and woodworker based in Portland, Oregon. I'm passionate about AI, robotics, and game development; there is nothing more
                exciting to me than creating dynamic code that takes on a life of its own. I'm especially interested in how robotics and artifical intelligence can be used
                to reduce humanity's impact on the planet and usher us forward into an age of sustainability. I am a full-stack developer; I love conquering both the logic puzzles and
                the design challenges that need to be overcome in order to make an application function perfectly.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me in my garden conducting experiments in permaculture or working on my latest carpentry project. <br>

                    <h4>Varmints</h4>
                    <p>A tiny ecosystem that uses pygame to simulate a fight for survival among rabbits, foxes, and grass. Varmints includes code that simulates evolution,
                    allowing each species to adapt to their environment. I am continuing to work on this project, and intend to add new species, new
                    survival strategies, and more complex environments with random events that drive evolution.</p>

                    <h4>Cascadia Skill Swap</h4>
                    <p>Cascadia Skill Swap is a social network and message board I'm developing to help people create resilient communities by teaching each other practical skills.
                    This concept occurred to me as cascading crises occurred in the US and I saw just how fragile our infrastructure is. I've coded a minimum viable product, but plan
                    to add many more features in the future. I intend to full deploy Skill Swap in the next year. In the meantime, you can check out the alpha version on Python Anywhere:
