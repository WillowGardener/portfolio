                <p>
                My name is Griffin; I'm a programmer and woodworker based in Portland, Oregon. I'm passionate about AI, robotics, and game development; there is nothing more
                exciting to me than creating dynamic code that takes on a life of its own. I'm especially interested in how robotics and artifical intelligence can be used
                to reduce humanity's impact on the planet and usher us forward into an age of sustainability. I am a full-stack developer; I love conquering both the logic puzzles and
                the design challenges that need to be overcome in order to make an application function perfectly.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me in my garden conducting experiments in permaculture or working on my latest carpentry project. <br>

                        <p>Varmints is a tiny ecosystem simulator. Varmints includes code that simulates evolution,
                        allowing each species to adapt to their environment. I originally coded it in pygame, and have recently updated it
                        in javascript, adding a UI panel where users can edit the statistics of the plants and animals, making it a sandbox game.

                        <p>Cascadia Skill Swap is a social network and message board I'm developing to help people create resilient communities by teaching each other practical skills.
                        This concept occurred to me as cascading crises occurred in the US and I saw just how fragile our infrastructure is. I've coded a minimum viable product, but plan
                        to add many more features in the future. I intend to full deploy Skill Swap in the next year. In the meantime, you can check out the alpha version on Python Anywhere:

                        so that he could direct his clients toward it, rather than sending out information manually over email.</p>
