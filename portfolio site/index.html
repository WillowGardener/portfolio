                My name is Griffin; I'm a programmer and woodworker based in Portland, Oregon. I'm passionate about AI, robotics, and game development; there is nothing more
                exciting to me than creating dynamic code that takes on a life of its own. I'm especially interested in how robotics and artifical intelligence can be used
                to reduce humanity's impact on the planet and usher us forward into an age of sustainability. I love working on the nitty-gritty logic of the back end;
                to me, nothing  quite compares to the thrill of solving all the little logic puzzles that are needed to make my code work.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me in my garden conducting experiments in permaculture or working on my latest project in green construction. <br>
